# Group-Project1
Description: We will create an app to explore new music and artists. Users will be able to select a musician or genre of music from a drop down menu or will be able to type in an artist's name in on an input bar. Once the user clicks a submit, the YouTube API will populate a corresponding music video; additional information from Wikipedia will also render.
